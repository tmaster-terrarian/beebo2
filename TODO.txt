        - first off, vague. secondly, its about half done.
    [x] all units have the same stat properties

modifiers
    [ ] picker screen
        [ ] decide whether it will be an individual object or a part of gm:
            individual
                - make it communicate well with other objects, keep confusion to a minimum
                - create and destroy instances effectively
            as a part of the gm
                - reduce confusion with other parts of the gm's code

        - stole-"inspired by" ror2

internal structure
    [-] more tightly controlled execution order
        - might be iffy later so unmarking done status
    [x] more centralized
        - stats being handled by gm as well
        - avoid making gm too absurdly unreadable (maybe use methods + some comments for organization?)
        - all menu screens should part of the same system, instead of three different ones lmao
    [x] import scribble
    [-] pausing
        [ ] create a better method of doing this (unless sign(global.dt) is a good enough option lole)
    [ ] utilize injection and composition more often
    [-] reduce the amount of for loops when it comes to item and especially buff behavior
