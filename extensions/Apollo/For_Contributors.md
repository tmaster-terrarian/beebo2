follow build instructions for Apollo at [Apollo/BUILD.md](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker/Apollo/blob/732f8e60daa1df8ae78f9c74f862fd52f59d9a54/BUILD.md). (be sure to donate to yal if you want because he's the goat)

copy the output files from Apollo_23/extensions/ and Apollo_23/scripts/ into the project folder

if all goes well, it should just work out of the box. If something went wrong make sure you followed the exact link above because it links to the specific version that beebo uses.

**NOTE**: this project adds some *very minor* modifications to the code (I believe it's literally just one function) to make Lua errors output to the log file, and unfortunately won't have that modification applied.
